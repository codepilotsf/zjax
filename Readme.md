# Zjax

Zjax is a lightweight yet powerful JavaScript library (4.2K gzipped) that brings modern SPA-like interactivity to your web pages with minimal effort. By simply adding intuitive "z-attributes" like `z-swap` and `z-action` to your HTML elements, Zjax lets you dynamically update parts of a web page or bind client-side JavaScript actions directly to the DOM — all without writing verbose JavaScript code.

Inspired by HTMX, Hotwire, and AlpineJS and compatible with *any* SSR backend like Rails, Laravel, Django, Astro – or even Wordpress, Zjax seamlessly integrates into your workflow.
